          Welcome to the Card Guessing Game!

The goal of the game is to guess whether the next card drawn from the deck will be higher or lower than the current card.

How to Play:
1. Starting the Game:  
   - The game begins with a shuffled deck of cards.
   - A card will be drawn and shown to you, along with its suit and rank (e.g., "5 of Hearts").

2. Making a Guess:
   - You need to decide whether the next card drawn from the deck will be higher or lower than the current card.
   - You will enter 'h' for "higher" or 'l' for "lower".

3. Card Rankings:
   - The cards are ranked from Ace (lowest) to King (highest)
   - Ace = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13.

4. Scoring:
   - Correct Guess: You will earn 20 points if your guess is right.
   - Incorrect Guess: You will lose 15 points if your guess is wrong.
   - You will only be disquallified if you end the game with a negative score.

5. Game Rounds:
   - The game consists of 8 rounds (guesses). After each guess, the next card becomes the "current card," and you continue guessing until all 8 cards are played.

6. Ending the Game:
   - After 8 rounds, youâ€™ll see your score, the highest score will be recorded.
   - You can choose to play again by pressing ENTER or quit the game by typing 'q'.

7. Initial Score:
   - You start the game with a score of 50 points.

Good luck, and have fun guessing whether the next card will be higher or lower!
